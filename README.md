# My Burger Builder Application

This is sample project I created while taking "React Complete Guide" course on Udemy, and it helped a lot understand the web application development using React.js from scratch.

In this project, I gained hands-on experience of React, Redux, Routing, Forms and Validations, HTTP Requests using Axios etc. It is also integrated with Google Firebase to store information like orders, ingeredients and prices etc.
