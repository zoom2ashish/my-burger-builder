Parallel requests\nfor ownership of the same path will only stat the directories one time.\n\n## API\n\n* `inferOwner(path) -> Promise<{ uid, gid }>`\n\n    If the path exists, return its uid and gid.  If it does not, look to\n    its parent, then its grandparent, and so on.\n\n* `inferOwner(path) -> { uid, gid }`\n\n    Sync form of `inferOwner(path)`.\n\n* `inferOwner.clearCache()`\n\n    Delete all cached ownership information and in-flight tracking.\n",
